Coaldale is a town that is primary a residential town where a family may want to raise their children. We also have multiple private and public schools and lots of business opportunities. We also have a variety of different green, well-kept parks scattered throughout the town most of which have ponds or small bodies of water. We also have biking and walking paths that are a great way to spend some time in the evenings and on weekends.</p></div></div>
