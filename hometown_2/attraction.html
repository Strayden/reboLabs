		<div id="item2"><p> Some attractions that Coaldale has is its Parade of Lights in November where people can enter the parade and join the fire department. You can also walk around before the parade starts and get free hot chocolate and apple cider while you stand around a bonfire. There is also the Settler’s Day candy parade on July 6th where the fire department drives around town and throws candy off the fire trucks for the people on the sidewalks. There’s plenty of free basketball and tennis courts around Coaldale. There is also free ice skating rink in the Cottonwood neighbourhood during the winter. We also have the Gem of the West Museum that has a bunch of unique antiques from the region to learn more about the region's history.</p></div></div>
