		<div id="item2"><p> Coaldale is located in southern Alberta and is an hour drive to the Montana boarder. We are surrounded by prairies which is primary used for farmland. The prairies help the town have an open feeling so that if someone were to travel here it wouldnâ€™t make them feel claustrophobic or closed in. This also helps infrastructure for the town. There is no need to find level ground to build on as its already level resulting in the ability for fast future growth for infrastructure.</p></div></div>
